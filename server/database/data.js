Your thoughts are fleeting and as much as you try to convince yourself that you're invincible and that you'll always remember- you won't. You're human and you're limited... and that realization had me collecting quotes from a young age, writing them down in order to immortalize my feelings for that particular stage of life.\n So here's to the end of March and all the quotes that concretize it: \n \"I write because people don't understand me when I talk, that's why I write... to understand myself.\" -Tatiana Flores \n \"The world is a complex place and there are great dangers when you start looking at everything purely in terms of black and white.\" -Alex Webb \n \"Is it painful to be the person who waits? Or is it more painful to be the person who makes others wait?\" -Osamu Dazai \n \"I've always envied people who sleep easily. Their brains must be cleaner, the floorboards of the skull well swept, all the little monsters closed up in a steamer trunk at the foot of the bed.\" -David Benioff \n \" What and how much had I lost by trying to do only what was expected of me instead of what I myself had wished to do?\" -Ralph Ellison \n \"What they say is great. But it's what they do that counts.\" -Charles Orlando "
